`CROSSING WIRES`

The width or shape of a wire is not important, nor its color, as long as the pixels are connected.

`Wires are allowed to cross`. Wires only connect at T or L connections.

Wires are only connected via up/down/left/right pixel neighbours. Diagonal pixels are not considered connected. In the example below, in the first case you have 4 different wires, while in the second example you have a single wire.
