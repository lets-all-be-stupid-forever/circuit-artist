`PROPAGATION DELAY`

Both NAND gates and wires have propagation delay. When you chain components together, delays add up.

**When to AVOID clock delay:**
You should generally avoid adding gates between the clock signal and flip-flop inputs. If some flip-flops receive the clock later than others, your memory will no longer be synchronous and you might have bugs.

**When to USE clock delay:**
However, there are cases where you WANT to delay the clock:

1. When you derive the clock from your data (like detecting button presses), the clock must arrive AFTER the data is stable. Use NOT-NOT chains to delay the clock.

2. To create gated clocks that reduce updates on unused circuit parts, saving simulation time (and power in real circuits).

In these cases, plan carefully and mind the propagation delays of your gates and wires.
