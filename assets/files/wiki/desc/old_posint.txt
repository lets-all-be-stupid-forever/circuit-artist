Positive Integers

We can represent `positive integer` (or `unsigned integer`) numbers by simply counting them in increasing order from 0 on. By doing that, every bit will represent a power of two.

So for example:
101 = 1*100 + 0*10 + 1*1 = 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 5 (3 bits number)
0100 = 0*1000 + 1*100 + 0*10 + 0*1 = 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 4 (4 bits number)
