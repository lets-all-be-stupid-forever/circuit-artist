`AND GATE`

The AND gate returns a 1 only if both inputs are 1, otherwise returns a 0. I.e., the output is only 1 if `a` AND `b` are 1.

Example:
a=0 b=0 --> AND=0
a=0 b=1 --> AND=0
a=1 b=0 --> AND=0
a=1 b=1 --> AND=1

An AND gate can be created using 2 NAND gates, as shown below. That is equivalent to a NAND gate followed by a NOT gate.
