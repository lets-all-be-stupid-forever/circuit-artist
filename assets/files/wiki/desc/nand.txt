`NAND GATE`

A NAND logic gate is represented by 3 pixels, as shown below.

The NAND logic gate has 2 inputs and 1 output. It reads the values of the inputs and, depending on those values, assigns a value to the output wire. The assignment table can be found below:

 a=0 b=0 --> NAND=1
 a=0 b=1 --> NAND=1
 a=1 b=0 --> NAND=1
 a=1 b=1 --> NAND=0

For example, if the 2 inputs are 0, then the output will be assigned to 1. See examples below.

The NAND gates can be drawn in any orientation (facing up, down, left or right):

Every non-black pixel in the image that is not part of a NAND gate is considered a wire, and has some state associated to it, as described below.
