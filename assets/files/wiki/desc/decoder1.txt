`DECODER`

!img:wiki/imgs/decoder_tut1.png

A decoder takes a binary input and outputs a signal where exactly one bit is high, indicating which input value was received.
Example:
A=0 --> D=01 (bit 0 active)
A=1 --> D=10 (bit 1 active)

A 1-bit input decoder can be implemented as in the example above.
