`MEMORY INITIALIZATION:` 

Flip flops don't have an initial state: the latches start at an undefined state, so everytime you have a synchronous circuit, before doing any calculation you need to initialize your memory somehow.

That's why we often introduce an extra auxiliar bit called `POWER-ON-RESET` that is 1 for a few initial clock cycles, then become zero.
