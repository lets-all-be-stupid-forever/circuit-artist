`BARREL SHIFTER`

A `barrel shifter` can perform any shift amount in a single operation using a crossbar network of multiplexers. For a 4-bit right shifter C = A >> B, the circuit works as follows:

`Structure`:
- Create a grid where each output bit can be connected to any input bit
- Use multiplexers at each output position to select the correct input based on the shift amount B
- The shift amount B acts as the select signal for all multiplexers

`How it works`:
- Each output bit position has a multiplexer that can choose from multiple input sources
- For a right shift by B positions, output[i] gets input[i+B] (with appropriate bounds checking)
- Positions that would receive bits from outside the input range are filled with zeros

`Key advantage`: Unlike simple shifters that shift one position per clock cycle, a barrel shifter can shift by any amount (0 to 3 positions for a 4-bit shifter) in one operation.

`Implementation`: The "crossbar" structure allows any input to route to any output through a network of multiplexers controlled by the shift amount.
