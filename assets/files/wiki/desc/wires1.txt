`BASIC WIRES`

!img:wiki/imgs/wires_pins_example.png

Wires are formed by connected non-black pixels. Wires can have 3 states as displayed below:
- `ON` (lighter color)
- `OFF` (darker color)
- `UNDEFINED` (magenta color)

The `ON` state represents the logic `1`, and the `OFF` state represents the logic `0`. Wires state can be toggled (1->0 or 0->1) by clicking on it during simulation mode.

The `UNDEFINED` state means that we don't know the state of the wire. Most wires start simulation in this state.
