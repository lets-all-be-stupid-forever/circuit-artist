`MUX`

A `MUX` is like a data `selector`: Given 2 inputs `a` and `b`, and a selection input `s`, if `s` is 0, `MUX` returns the value of `a`, and if `s` is 1, `MUX` returns the value of `b`.

Muxes work like selectors (or a "switch"). They're useful for example when you have multiple calculations and want to select only one of the results. It's like an 'if' statement in programming: IF S=0, RETURN A; ELSE IF S=1, RETURN B.
