`Objective`: Build a circuit that shifts a 4-bit input one position to the right, with the rightmost bit wrapping around to become the leftmost bit.

`Operation`:
- All bits move one position to the right
- The rightmost bit (bit 0) wraps around to become the leftmost bit (bit 3)
- No bits are lost in the process

Example: 
- 0 >> 1 = 0 (0000 -> 0000)
- 1 >> 1 = 8 (0001 -> 1000)
- 2 >> 1 = 1 (0010 -> 0001)
- 8 >> 1 = 4 (1000 -> 0100)
