Connect the 4-bit wire `A_in` to `A_out`.

Note that `A` connections now have each 4 wires/bits.

For multi-bit connections, the lowest bit is the upper one both in the input and ouput, so they should be connected in the same order.

You can use the "line tool" to make the task easier (check the tool tooltip for instructions).
