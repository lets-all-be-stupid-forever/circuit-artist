`TUTORIAL`: TWO'S COMPLEMENT REPRESENTATION

Signed integers use two's complement format, where negative numbers are represented using the formula: -N = NOT(N) + 1

Example: To find -3 in 4-bit two's complement:
- Start with +3: 0011
- Invert all bits: 1100
- Add 1: 1100 + 1 = 1101
- Therefore -3 = 1101

Subtraction Method:

Since A - B = A + (-B), we can perform subtraction by:
- Converting B to -B using two's complement: NOT(B) + 1
- Adding: A - B = A + NOT(B) + 1
