Objective: Implement a demux: given a multi-bit input `a`, return it to the n-th output `d_n` if the value of `s` is `n`.

For example:

- `s=0` --> `d0`=`a`, `d1`=0
- `s=1` --> `d0`=0, `d1`=`a`

A `DEMUX` is like a bit `router`: Given an input bit `a`, 2 outputs `Y0` and `Y1` and a selector bit `s`, if `s` is 0, then set `Y0` to the value of `a` and `Y1` to 0. Otherwise, if `s` is 1, set `Y0` to 0 and `Y1` to the value of `a`.

Demuxes work like routers: you have a wire and the selector bit chooses to which wire the input bit should go.
Example:
a=0, s=0 --> Y0 = 0, Y1 = 0
a=1, s=0 --> Y0 = 1, Y1 = 0
a=0, s=1 --> Y0 = 0, Y1 = 0
a=1, s=1 --> Y0 = 0, Y1 = 1
A demux can be implemented as follows:
