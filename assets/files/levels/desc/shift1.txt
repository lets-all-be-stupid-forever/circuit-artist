`Objective`: Build a circuit that shifts a 4-bit input `a` one position to the right, discarding the rightmost bit and filling the leftmost position with 0.

`Operation`:
- All bits move one position to the right
- The rightmost bit (bit 0) is discarded and lost
- The leftmost position (bit 3) is filled with 0

Example:
- 0 >> 1 = 0 (0000 -> 0000)
- 1 >> 1 = 0 (0001 -> 0000)
- 2 >> 1 = 1 (0010 -> 0001)
- 8 >> 1 = 4 (1000 -> 0100)

`Note`: This is equivalent to integer division by 2 (with truncation) for unsigned numbers.
