Objective: Compare two unsigned 4-bit numbers `a` and `b` and tell if `a` is bigger, equal or smaller than `b`.

`TUTORIAL`: DIGITAL COMPARATORS

We can extend the 1-bit comparator to accept inputs from a "more significant" bit. The idea is to do it the same way we do to compare two numbers: first we check if the most significant digit is equal, lower or higher than the other: if it's lower or higher we know whether a number is lower or higher, but if they're equal, we need to move forward to the next digit, creating a sequence of comparisons.

The formulas will look like the following, where `Aprv` = previous A, ie, result from previous comparator (from a more signficant bit), and `Anxt` = next A, ie, result going to next comparator (towards a least significant bit).

`A`<`Bnxt` = (`A`<`Bprv`) OR (`A`=`Bprv` AND `A`<`B`)
`A`=`Bnxt` = (`A`=`Bprv`) AND (`A`=`B`)
`A`>`Bnxt` = (`A`>`Bprv`) OR (`A`=`Bprv` AND `A`>`B`)

Then, similarly to the addition, we chain these comparators to create a bigger comparator for N bits.
