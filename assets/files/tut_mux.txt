What is a Multiplexer (MUX)?

A multiplexer, often called a "MUX", is a digital circuit that acts as a SELECTOR or SWITCH. It chooses one input from multiple input options and passes it to the output.

Think of it like a railway switch that can direct a train down one of several tracks - except instead of trains, we're directing electrical signals (bits).

How a 2:1 MUX Works:

The simplest multiplexer is a 2:1 MUX (pronounced "two-to-one mux"):
- It has TWO data inputs: typically called 'a' and 'b'
- It has ONE selector input: typically called 's' (or 'sel')
- It has ONE output

The selector bit 's' controls which input gets passed to the output:
- When s = 0: output = a (select input 'a')
- When s = 1: output = b (select input 'b')

Truth Table for 2:1 MUX:

| s | a | b | output |
|---|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | X | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | X | 1      |
| 1 | X | 0 | 0      |
| 1 | X | 1 | 1      |

(X means "don't care" - the value doesn't matter)

Real-World Analogy:

Imagine you have two music sources (a radio and a phone) and one speaker. A physical switch lets you choose which source plays through the speaker. A MUX works the same way, but with digital signals!

Programming Equivalent:

In programming, a MUX is like an IF statement:

if (s == 0):
    output = a
else:
    output = b

or more compactly: output = (s == 0) ? a : b

Why Are MUXes Useful?

1. Data Selection: Choose between different data sources
2. Conditional Logic: Implement IF-THEN logic in hardware
3. Data Routing: Send data down different paths
4. Building Complex Circuits: Combine multiple MUXes to create larger selectors

Larger Multiplexers:

You can build bigger multiplexers by combining smaller ones:
- 4:1 MUX: 4 inputs, 2 selector bits, 1 output
- 8:1 MUX: 8 inputs, 3 selector bits, 1 output
- 16:1 MUX: 16 inputs, 4 selector bits, 1 output

The pattern: for N inputs, you need log2(N) selector bits.

For example, a 4:1 MUX:
- 4 data inputs: a, b, c, d
- 2 selector bits: s1, s0
- When s1s0 = 00: output = a
- When s1s0 = 01: output = b
- When s1s0 = 10: output = c
- When s1s0 = 11: output = d
