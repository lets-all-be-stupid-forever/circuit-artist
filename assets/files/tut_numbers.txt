In everyday life, we count using the decimal system (base-10), which uses ten different digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

In computers and digital circuits, we use the binary system (base-2), which uses only TWO digits: 0 and 1.

How Binary Numbers Work:

Just like in decimal where each position represents a power of 10 (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands...), in binary each position represents a power of 2.

Reading from RIGHT to LEFT:
- The rightmost bit (bit 0) represents 2^0 = 1
- The next bit (bit 1) represents 2^1 = 2
- The next bit (bit 2) represents 2^2 = 4
- The next bit (bit 3) represents 2^3 = 8
- And so on: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256...

To find the decimal value of a binary number, add up the powers of 2 for each position that has a 1.

Examples:

Binary: 101
= 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1
= 4 + 0 + 1
= 5 in decimal

Binary: 1010
= 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 0×1
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
= 10 in decimal

Binary: 11111
= 1×16 + 1×8 + 1×4 + 1×2 + 1×1
= 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1
= 31 in decimal

Binary: 00000 = 0 in decimal
Binary: 00001 = 1 in decimal
Binary: 00010 = 2 in decimal
Binary: 00011 = 3 in decimal
Binary: 00100 = 4 in decimal
Binary: 00101 = 5 in decimal

This is how digital circuits represent numbers using only electrical signals that are either ON (1) or OFF (0).
