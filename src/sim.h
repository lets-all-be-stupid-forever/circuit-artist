// This is the lower level simulation that is applied to the wires/nands in the
// image.
//
// Then, there's another layer on top of it that alternates between the image
// and the external components until convergence, as in the pseudo-code below:
//
// FUNCTION simulate(wire_state, wire_graph, events, comps)
//    REPEAT:
//       WHILE events IS NOT EMPTY DO
//          wire_state, events := SIMULATE_EVENT_STEP(wire_state, wire_graph,
//          events)
//       ENDWHILE
//       FOR EACH COMPONENT comp IN comps DO
//          IF (comp IS DIRTY) OR (COMP_INPUT_HAS_CHANGED(comp, wire_state))
//          THEN
//              SIMULATE_COMP(comp, wire_state)
//              IF COMP_OUTPUT_HAS_CHANGED(comp, wire_state) THEN
//                 events = events + DIFF(comp_next_output, comp_prev_output)
//              ENDIF
//          ENDIF
